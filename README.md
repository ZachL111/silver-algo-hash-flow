# silver-algo-hash-flow

`silver-algo-hash-flow` is a focused OCaml codebase around package an OCaml local lab for hash analysis with windowed input fixtures, late-data behavior checks, and documented operating limits. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Silver Algo Hash Flow Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the algorithms idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Reason For The Project

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## How It Is Put Together

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The OCaml implementation keeps the data record and functions small enough to load directly in the test file.

## Data Notes

`pressure` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 77. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -19 and `surge` at 240, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Capabilities

- Uses fixture data to keep complexity tradeoffs changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for golden cases, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents boundary checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Getting It Running

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Tradeoffs

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Possible Extensions

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more algorithms fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
